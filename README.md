# x86utm
<b>A Universal Turing Machine (UTM) with the x86 language as its TM description language.</b>

This x86 based Universal Turing Machine (UTM) directly executes COFF object files generated by the Microsoft "C" compiler.

There are two restrictions on the "C" code that can be executed in this virtual machine:
(1) All global data must be initialized.
(2) No library function can be called.

<b>The UTM environment is like a tiny little operating system here are its only functions:</b>

// allocates memory from Heap_Space.<br>
<b>Tu32* Allocate(u32 size); </b>

// executes a slave UTM in single step debug mode<br>
<b>Tu32 Debug_Step(u32* master_state, u32* slave_state);</b>

// Saves the execution state of a UTM to state_data<br>
<b>Tu32 Save_State(u32* state_data);  </b>

// Loads the execution state of a UTM from state_data<br>
<b>Tu32 Load_State(u32* state_data);  </b>

When a UTM is running the execution trace of each assembly language instruction / operating system function call is provided.
After each Debug_Step() virtual machine instruction is executed the Master UTM can examine the machine state of the Slave UTM.
