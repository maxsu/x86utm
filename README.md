# x86utm
<b>A Universal Turing Machine (UTM) with the x86 language as its TM description language.</b><br>

This x86 based Universal Turing Machine (UTM) directly executes COFF object files generated by the Microsoft "C" compiler. <br>
There are two restrictions on the "C" code that can be executed in this virtual machine: <br>
(1) All global data must be initalized. <br>
(2) No library function can be called. <br>
The UTM environment is like a tiny little operating system here are its only functions:

<b>u32* Allocate(u32 size);</b>-------------------------------------// allocates memory from HeapSpace.<br>
<b>u32 DebugStep(u32* master_state, u32* slave_state);</b>----// executes a slave UTM in single step debug mode <br>
<b>u32 SaveState(u32* state_data);</b>----------------------------// Saves the execution state of a UTM to state_data<br>
<b>u32 LoadState(u32* state_data);</b>----------------------------// Loads the execution state of a UTM from state_data<br>

When a UTM is running the execution trace of each assembly language instruction / operating system function call is provided.
